BOOK EXPLORER WEB APPLICATION
1. Project Overview

The Book Explorer Web Application is a responsive web app that allows users to search for books and explore popular fiction titles. The project dynamically fetches data from the Open Library API and displays books in a clean and interactive layout.

This project demonstrates the use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript modules (import/export), API integration, and GitHub collaboration workflow.

2. Project Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

To build a dynamic web application using JavaScript.

To fetch and display data from an external API.

To implement a favorites feature.

To practice Git branching and collaboration simulation using GitHub.

3. Features
3.1 Automatic Fiction Books Loading

When the application loads, fiction books are automatically displayed using data fetched from the Open Library API.

3.2 Search Functionality

Users can search for books by title. The results update dynamically based on the user’s input.

3.3 Favorites Feature

Users can:

Add books to favorites.

Remove books from favorites.

View selected favorite books.

3.4 Responsive Design

The application adapts to different screen sizes including:

Desktop

Tablet

Mobile devices

4. Technologies Used

HTML

CSS

JavaScript (ES6 Modules – import/export)

Open Library API

Git

GitHub (Branches, Issues, Pull Requests)

5. Project Structure and Branching (Lab 4 Simulation)

To simulate real-world collaboration, the project was developed using multiple branches:

lab1-layout → Responsible for the user interface and layout design.

lab2-favorites → Responsible for implementing the favorites feature.

lab3-api → Responsible for API integration and search functionality.

main → Final integrated branch.

This demonstrates understanding of:

Branch creation

Merging

Tracking changes

Managing feature-based development

6. GitHub Collaboration Simulation

For Lab 4, the following collaboration tools were used:

GitHub Issues for tracking tasks and improvements.

Feature branches for separate development.

Pull request workflow simulation.

Branch comparison (ahead/behind commits).

This simulates a team development environment.

7. How to Run the Project

Clone the repository:
git clone <your-repository-link>

Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code.

Open index.html using Live Server.

Ensure the JavaScript file is linked as a module:

<script type="module" src="main.js"></script>
