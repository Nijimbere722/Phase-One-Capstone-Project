# BOOK EXPLORER WEB APPLICATION
## Project Overview

* The Book Explorer Web Application is a responsive web app that allows users to search for books and explore popular fiction titles. The project dynamically fetches data from the Open Library API and displays books in a clean and interactive layout.

This project demonstrates the use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript modules (import/export), API integration, and GitHub collaboration workflow.

# Project Objectives

## The main objectives of this project are:

* To build a dynamic web application using JavaScript.

* To fetch and display data from an external API.

*To implement a favorites feature.

*To practice Git branching and collaboration simulation using GitHub.

# Features
3.1 Automatic Fiction Books Loading

When the application loads, fiction books are automatically displayed using data fetched from the Open Library API.

# Search Functionality

JavaScript (ES6 Modules – import/export)

Open Library API

Git

GitHub (Branches, Issues, Pull Requests)
# Project Structure and Branching (Lab 4 Simulation)

To simulate real-world collaboration, the project was developed using multiple branches:

lab1-layout → Responsible for the user interface and layout design.

lab2-favorites → Responsible for implementing the favorites feature.

lab3-api → Responsible for API integration and search functionality.

main → Final integrated branch.

This demonstrates understanding of:

Branch creation

Merging

Tracking changes

Managing feature-based development

# How to Run the Project
